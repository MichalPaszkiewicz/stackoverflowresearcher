But the extension of the idea to quantificational logic is problematic [...]\"</p>\n\n<p>In <em>sequent calculus</em> we have also, as a corollary to the <em>cut-elimination</em> theorem, the <em>subformula property</em> [Takeuti, page 29] :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a cut-free proof in <strong>LK</strong> (or <strong>LJ</strong>) all the formulas which occur in it are subformulas of the formulas in the end-sequent. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gentzen's \"Hauptsatz\" is often described : \"as stating that a proof can be so organized that\nthe premisses of each step of inference are always simpler [or not more complicated] than its conclusion\" [Sara Negri &amp; Jan von Plato, <em>Structural Proof Theory</em> (2001), page xii].</p>\n\n<p>This property seems to me the precise counterpart of Frege goal of the formalization :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>that through formalization “we arrive at a small number of laws in which, if we add those contained in the rules, the content of all the laws is included, albeit in an undeveloped state” (Frege, <em>Begriffsschrift</em>, 1879). </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My exposition boil down to the question :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>May we say that <em>sequent calculus</em> support the idea that <em>logical truth</em> are the formulas provable from <em>basic logical axioms</em>, i.e. from fomulas that are \"tautologies\" (in the sense of \"trivial\" truth whose truth we may ascertain \"by inspection\") formed with \"elementary propositions\" (again Wittgenstein) ? And that these formulas are \"analytic\" (in the sense of Kant and Frege)?</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In support of this interpretation (and this fact clarify, for me, also the interreletionship between logic and mathematics), I suggest to consider also the way in which Gentzen extends <em>sequent calculus</em> to arithmetic [page 151] :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A basic <em>mathematical sequent</em> is a sequent of the form $\\rightarrow C$, where the formula $C$ represents a 'mathematical axiom'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the above interpretation, the formula $C$ is <em>not</em> a \"tautology\", and the mathematical theorems proved in the <em>sequent calculus</em> with the addition of \"mathematical axioms\" are clearly nor more \"analytic\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It is well-known that <em>sequent calculus</em> and <em>natural deduction</em> have their common origin in Gentzen's work.</p>\n\n<p>There is a \"standard\" translation from cut-free derivations in the <em>sequent calculus</em> to natural deduction derivations [see Negri &amp; von Plato, chapter 8].</p>\n\n<p>In <em>natural derivation</em> there are no <em>axioms</em> : the said translation maps the sequent $A \\rightarrow A$ into an <em>assumption</em> $A$.</p>\n\n<p>So my final question is : </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>What is wrong in the above interpretation of <em>logical truth</em> \"according to\" <em>sequent calculus</em> ?

He uses the term only in the context of 'mathematical axioms', i.e. for <em>basic mathematical sequent</em> [page 151].</p>\n\n<p>So we may \"restore the simmetry\" between <em>sequent calculus</em> and <em>natural deduction</em> : <em>initial sequents</em> are - exactly as <em>assumptions</em> - a way to \"bootstrap\" the inferences.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, <em>sequent calculus</em> (exactly as <em>natural deduction</em>) support the idea that a <em>logical calculus</em> is based on <em>inference rules</em> : in this sense, it is eminently \"formal\".</p>\n\n<p>Only when we \"apply\" it, i.e.introduce <em>mathematical</em> axioms (or axioms partaining to other sciences), we \"introduce meaning\".</p>\n\n<p>If this view is sound, it seems to me to maintain a \"strictly formal\" characterization of <em>logical truth</em>; in order to characterize it we need <em>semantics</em>, via the concept of <em>validity</em>.</p>\n","answer":"<p>I don't think there's necessarily anything deep going on here.</p>\n\n<p>Your initial observation seems to be simply that we can trade logical axioms for rules of inference and vice versa. A Hilbert-type system tries to have as few rules of inference as possible (namely modus ponens; it needs at least one in order to be able to do anything) and puts all the work in the axioms, whereas sequent calculus goes to the other extreme and does all the work with a plethora of inference rules while sticking to the simplest imaginable axiom.</p>\n\n<p>In principle it would be equally possible to phrase most of the <em>non-logical</em> axioms of a theory as rules of inference rather than axioms. For example, if we're doing Peano Arithmetic in natural deduction, we could choose to write the induction rule as\n$$\\frac{n=0\\to\\psi \\qquad (\\forall n. n=x\\to\\psi)\\to(\\forall n.n=S(x)\\to\\psi)}{\\psi}\nx\\text{ not free in }\\psi$$</p>\n\n<p>The only reason why we're not routinely doing that is that we often want to collect the non-logical axioms as \"objects of interest\" themselves, to be manipulated, put into sets and so forth, which is technically more convenient if they are formulas than if they're rules of inference.</p>\n\n<p>Thus I think the rule/axiom scale exemplified by Hilbert or Gentzen style is more or less orthogonal to the concept of \"logical truth\", taken to mean formulas that can be proved by purely <em>logical</em> means (whether these logical means are axioms or rules), without using any of the theory-specific rules/axioms.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/696241/measure-of-induction-for-cut-elimination-in-sequent-calculus","title":"&quot;Measure&quot; of induction for cut-elimination in sequent calculus","creationDate":1393770580,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"math","questionID":696241,"body":"<p>I'm not very familiar with proof thoery, so I'm in trouble understanding different versions of the proof of the <em>Cut-elimination Theorem</em> for sequent calculus.</p>\n\n<p>In Sara Negri &amp; Jan von Plato, <em>Structural Proof Theory</em> (2001), page 35 :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the proof of admissibility of cut is by induction on the weight [amounting to the length of a formula] of the cut formula and a subinduction on the sum of heights of derivations [where the height of a derivation is the greatest number of successive applications of rules in it] of the two premisses. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Gaisi Takeuti, <em>Proof Theory</em> (2nd ed - 1987), page 23, a preliminary <em>Lemma</em> is proved with Proof of Lemma 5.4.

I mean, in the proof of [T1987], after having fixed a formula of grade $n$, he does the inner induction on the <em>rank</em> of whole proof $P$, where $J$ is the sequent that concludes the formula that is fixed from the outer induction (which is $Q$). Then, the <em>rank</em> of $P$ with respect to $J$ is the maximum path of the subtree that $J$ defines.

What you stated to be $\\omega\\times\\omega$ is the <strong>space</strong> from which $v$ takes values. Actually, the expression $\\omega\\cdot g+r$ defines a hierarchy on the two inductions. In this case, it means that induction on $r$ is a subinduction of the induction on $g$. This is because $v(g,r)=\\omega g +r=g+r=\\max\\{g,r\\}$ ($\\omega g$ is the intersection of $\\omega$ and $g$, which is of course $g$ and $g+r$ is the union of $g$ and $r$, which is their maximum). So, you have variable $v$ defined as:\n$$v(g,r)=\n\\begin{cases}\ng,~\\text{ if } g\\geq  r\\\\\nr,~\\text{ if } g&lt; r\n\\end{cases}$$</p>\n\n<p>But this is the same as doing an outer induction on $g$ and then doing an inner induction on $r$, for $r\\leq g$.

In fact, Cauchy apparently never gave an epsilon-delta definition of either <em>limit</em> or <em>continuity</em>.  His infinitesimal definition of continuity (\"infinitesimal $x$-increment always produces infinitesimal $y$-increment\") is reproduced in a number of secondary studies, for example in J.

The analysis extends in a straightforward way to rational and even irrational power of $x$, but Thomae noted that the natural logarithm, the function $\\ln(x)$, goes very slowly to $-\\infty$ as $x$ remains positive and tends to zero, so the function $\\frac{1}{\\ln (x)}$ goes to zero very slowly as x tends to zero; slower, in fact, than any power of $x$.

Wildberger has problems with circles.  I believe one of the reasons is that, in real 2-space for example, the points of a circle would have many irrational (indeed, transcendental) coordinates, and the real numbers are a problem for him.  I'll go further: there are no actual circles in nature, best we can tell.  Anything that appears circular must have imperfections at some level of precision.

If you ask a lot of mathematicians this question, they'd give you some silly example showing you that, for example, only $\\frac{1}{1000}$ of all numbers are odd.  They'd do this by constructing a bijection like the following mapping every odd number to a distinct sequence of $999$ even numbers: </p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\phi(1)=(2,4,6,8,\\dots,1998) \\\\\n\\phi(3)=(2000,2002,\\dots,3998) \\\\\n\\dots\n$$</p>\n\n<p>However, this approach only uses the <em>combinatorial</em> structure of the integers, and ignores the <em>algebraic</em> structure.  If we require $\\phi$ to be not just a bijection from the odd numbers to some sequence of even numbers, but instead to be a group homomorphism whose kernel is the even numbers, we have only one choice: </p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\phi(n)=n\\mod 2\n$$</p>\n\n<p>For finite groups, we know that $|G|/|\\ker\\phi| = |\\phi(G)|$.  If we pretend that this applies to infinite groups as well, then that means that there are twice as many integers as there are even numbers, since the image of our homomorphism is the two-element group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.  Therefore, half of all integers are odd.  </p>\n\n<p>Another approach we could take is to use the orbit-stabilizer theorem, which states that for a finite group $G$, a set $X$ and an action $\\psi:G\\times X\\to X$, we have $|G|=|\\mathrm{orb}_\\psi(x)||\\mathrm{stab}_\\psi(x)|$ for any $x\\in X$, where $\\mathrm{orb}_\\psi(x)$ is the orbit of $x$ under $\\psi$ and $\\mathrm{stab}_\\psi(x)$ is the stabilizer of $x$ under $\\psi$.  If we pretend this applies to infinite groups, we can take $G=\\mathbb{Z}$, $X=\\{\\{\\textrm{odd numbers}\\}, \\{\\textrm{even numbers}\\}\\}$, and let $G$ act on $X$ by addition.  Then the orbit of the set of odd numbers is the whole of $X$, which has size $2$, and the stabilizer of that set is precisely the set of even numbers.  So we get </p>\n\n<p>$$\n|\\mathbb{Z}| = 2\\left|\\{\\textrm{even numbers}\\}\\right|\n$$</p>\n\n<p>and therefore, half of all integers are odd.  </p>\n\n<p>Another, more combinatorial approach, is as follows.  We might not want to take full advantage of the algebraic structure of $\\mathbb{Z}$, but the example at the top showing that the odd numbers occupy only $\\frac{1}{1000}$ of the integers seems silly for a nother reason: the images of the odd numbers $\\phi(n)$ are too far away from the odd numbers themselves!  One way of using this is to define the notion of density, which has been done above.  Consider instead the following approach.  Let the integers be the vertices of a graph, and join two integers if they are adjacent.  So $2$ and $3$ are joined by an edge, while $2$ and $4$ are not.  (This makes sense, because adjacent numbers are in some sense close together.  It would be silly to connect the number $3$ to the number $2000$.)  </p>\n\n<p>Then this graph is bipartite, and its vertex sets are precisely the set of odd numbers and the set of even numbers.  Moreover, the graph is regular, as each vertex has precisely two neighbours.  A simple counting argument shows that all finite regular bipartite graphs have vertex sets that are the same size.  <em>If we pretend that this applies to infinite regular bipartite graphs</em> (notice a theme here?) then we see that the set of odd numbers and the set of even numbers are the same size, so half of all integers are odd.  </p>\n"},{"link":"http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/25339/how-to-self-study-plato","title":"How to self study Plato?","creationDate":1438706642,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"philosophy","questionID":25339,"body":"<p>I started to self study Plato but I am not sure how to arrange my knowledge.

I believe I'm understanding what Socrates is saying; however I do not think it is correct.</p>\n\n<p>Referring to 10d to 11b</p>\n\n<p>Socrates forces Euthyphro make a definition 'piety'. Then, Euthyphro, quite carelessly, says 'Something loved by all gods is pious.'</p>\n\n<p>Socrates questions this statement in a lot ways to point out that, in fact, Euthyphro knows nothing about so-called piety.</p>\n\n<p>One of the methods that Socrates chose is to show that 'god-loved' and 'pious' are logically not equal. In order to that, first, Socrates persuades Euthyphro (and me) that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is not being loved by those who love it because it is something loved,\n  but it is something loved because it is being loved by them</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I understand from this statement is that Socrates is suggesting that something is <em>loved</em> because there exists something that <em>loves</em> it. So a necessary condition for <strong>A</strong> to be <em>loved</em> is that there exists something that <em>loves</em> <strong>A</strong>. It would be false to say something <em>loves</em> <strong>A</strong> because it is <strong>inherently</strong> loved. That makes sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>Socrates continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then <strong>the god-loved is not the same as the pious</strong>, Euthyphro, nor the pious the same as the god-loved, as you say it is, but one\n  differs from the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Socrates defends his statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Because we agree that the pious is being loved for this\n  reason, that it is pious</strong>, but it is not pious because it is being loved. Is\n  that not so? And that the god-loved, on the other hand, is so because\n  it is being loved by the gods, by the very fact of being loved, but it is\n  not being loved because it is god-loved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He, then, concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But if the god-loved and the pious were the same, my\n  dear Euthyphro, then if the pious was being loved because it was pious,\n  the god-loved would also be being loved because it was god-loved; and\n  if the god-loved was god-loved because it was being loved by the gods,\n  then the pious would also be pious because it was being loved by the\n  gods. <strong>But now you see that they are in opposite cases as being altogether\n  different from each other: the one is such as to be loved because it is\n  being loved, the other is being loved because it is such as to be loved.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Socrates says that if <strong>B</strong> is <em>pious</em>, then <strong>B</strong> is <em>god-loved</em>. (Socrates says something is loved because it is pious); but, according to him, we cannot say if <strong>B</strong> is <em>god-loved</em>, then it is <em>pious</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I do not think this statement is similar to that statement said by him earlier (my first quote). Let me name statements said by Socrates:</p>\n\n<p><strong>P</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Something is not being loved by those who love it because it is something loved; but it is something loved because it is being loved by them</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Q</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pious is being loved because it is pious; but it is not pious because it is being loved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>R</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God-loved, is so because it is being loved by the gods, by the very fact of being loved, but it is not being loved because it is god-loved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My point: I do not agree with Socrates that statement <strong>Q</strong> is a consequence of <strong>P</strong>. I agree with <strong>P</strong> and I also agree that <strong>R</strong> is a natural consequence of <strong>P</strong>. But I cannot see what does <strong>Q</strong> have to do with <strong>P</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>To me, it is quite logical to define \"pious\" as \"god-loved\" provided \"god-loved\" is explained well. In this case the necessary and satisfactory condition of <em>god-loved</em> is to be loved by all gods. So if we say something is pious if and it is god-loved; we conclude: if something is loved by all gods, then it is pious. I cannot see the logical mistake here.</p>\n\n<p>Please bear in mind that, I think previous attempts of Socrates are valid. Euthyphro fails to explain why are there wars between gods. If there are wars between them, then we can find something loved by some gods, disliked by other. This is a very valid point. But we can still define \"pious\" as \"something loved by all gods\". This itself is not erroneous unlike what Socrates says. </p>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All quotes are directly quoted from <em>Five Dialogues - Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Phaedo</em>, Plato, Second Edition, Translated by G.

The Idea is nothing else than that which is known to us more familiarly by the name of the Universal, regarded, however, not as the formal Universal, which is only a property of things, but as implicitly and explicitly existent, as reality, as that which alone is true. We translate eidoς first of all as species or kind; and the Idea is no doubt the species, but rather as it is apprehended by and exists for Thought.

Plato mocked in Republic the appearence of \"becoming\" in the way geometers operated \"<em>the science itself is utterly opposed to the proofs as stated in it by its practitioners...

But modern mathematics is also full of highly non-constructivist constructions, like Cantor's generation of ordinals and cardinals, or maximal ideals, algebraic closures, and everything else involving the axiom of choice. The whole architecture of pure mathematics is based on this, relations and functions are constructed from sets, groups, posets, etc. are sets with relations and functions, then there are spaces of functions on them, operators and functionals on those, and on and on. </p>\n\n<p>Agreeing with Plato seems to diminish the import of these hierarchic constructions, if not dismiss them as chatter.

I'm following Aristotle's concept of Efficient and Final Cause and Plato's concept of True Forms.  <em>What is the True Form of intelligence?  What is the Final Cause of intelligence?</em>  Is it merely evolution?  Or is intelligence the final cause of evolution, which was used to produce the efficient cause [evolution] of consciousness in humans?  I gather it might have been purposeful if you ponder the 4 causes.</p>\n\n<p>If evolution is the efficient cause, is there a true form of intelligence that evolution is mimicking?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Original Post</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, a quote by Aristotle, \"<strong>If, therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in nature.</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>Kind of like cause and effect.  But on an intellectual level.</p>\n\n<p>Following Aristotle's 4 types of causes.  If science is the efficient cause of humans, who is science's Final Cause, or the intent of science?  If we are the afterthought of a design of the creator who implemented science to create us, same as a sculpturer is the efficient cause of a statue, but the final cause is the concept the sculpturer has of which he is trying to imbue into this statue.  The cognitive memory, or intent.  Humans can serve as the intent of science.</p>\n\n<p>So carrying that forward to ourselves, and our own intelligence.  Our intelligence is the efficient cause of being human, of the affect of being placed within the universe by the universe's own mechanisms, and we have become aware and can understand our surroundings.  As I have previously mentioned, the efficient cause is science, but what is the final cause of science?</p>\n\n<p>So that begs the question, at least in my opinion, who asked the question of science that produced the ordered system of scientific results (applying Socrates reasoning here by asking questions)?  </p>\n\n<p>We find that we asked the question ourselves, through logic and deductive reasoning; given to us not by ourselves, but by the laws of the Universe having produced us.  We are able to shed light on the subject.  However, that light is only us understanding the logical order of the universe as exposed by science.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>\nSo... if science is seen to have a conceptual order to it.  Doesn't that order beg the question to require intelligence to understand it; <strong>and therefore could be argued required intelligence to have it implemented (same as the final cause and the statue)</strong>?  Couldn't the laws of science and it's resultant movement be regarded as the divine, for it is the reason we all have life and thought?</p>\n\n<p>I guess a shorter question is.  Can science be the efficient cause of ourselves existing, can we therefore ask what is the Final cause of science?   </p>\n\n<p>Or, can order be present without intelligence to present it, does our ability to reason demand a purpose...?</p>\n\n<p><strong>One obvious answer</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Is it simply enough to say that it has just been [science].  Science's requirement of requiring intelligent life to make sense of it does not necessitate intelligence to have supplied it [science].</p>\n\n<p>That I think would be a logical fallacy in it's own right.  It's like saying a room full of chimpanzees (the random universe) has a [small] chance of alphabetizing a list for us [the alphabetized list is the efficient cause, which can be translated to us human beings].  Even if we did see the list alphabetized.  We would reason the chimpanzees had some sort of intelligence to have done so rather than attribute it to some random chance event.  </p>\n\n<p>So again, seeing human's exist in a universe being able to reason is almost like seeing an alphabetized list and asking oneself who made the alphabetized list.  Who made this construct of applied reason?  Am I to believe that the random machinations of entropy can produce intelligence without any type of plan to do so, or is science a natural producer of intelligence because it was designed that way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>\nTo respond to Einer</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the watchmaker analagy.</p>\n\n<p>Richard Dawkins.

Richard posits that the plane required another initial mover.  That's not the case with our supposed closed system of the universe.  Everything was set by the initial mover.

First, these alternative theories weren't comprehensive, they only covered a limited range of phenomena, even quantum mechanics excludes relativity and quantum field theory.

His answer to the second was even more creative. Before birth our soul contemplates the ideal world directly, but forgets the experience upon birth. Interacting with imitations of ideas jogs our memory of them leading to the ideal truths, the process he called anamnesis (unforgetting). While <a href=\"http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/8219/archaic-mathematical-reality-as-referred-to-by-mathematician-alain-connes\">modern Platonists</a> may accept the imitation theory I doubt that many of them would subscribe to anamnesis. Cleared of fantastic elements it essentially equips us with a version of \"mindsight\", a sixth sense that reveals the ideal world directly, unlike the other five. There is no evidence in the work of mathematicians that we possess such a thing, which is probably why Plato moved his mindsight to pre-birth. And if this mindsight is intuition then it is a rather unreliable source. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if we do not have direct access to the ideal and only reconstruct it from the imperfect reality then there is a problem. Not only can't we be absolutely certain that our reconstructions establish truths about it, we can't even be sure they reflect it at all. Leibniz expanded the imitation theory to \"pre-established harmony\" between the ideal, the material, and our mind, which exists because \"God creates the best and most harmonious world\". But this is no better than mindsight. And it gets worse. All we actually have to go on then are our interactions with reality and the process of reconstruction.

But it seems that all answers essentially concede non-existence of the ideal world, and either make an emotion/motivation based arguments for Platonism \"in practice only\", or reinterpret ideas conceptualistically.

Mathematics as it exists is a study of the most schematic properties of physical objects, it has both theoretical and empirical aspects. If our world consisted of unstable shapes constantly morphing into each other we would have a very different kind of geometry, if the objects we encounter sprouted new ones when put together we would have a very different kind of arithmetic and set theory. </p>\n\n<p>Mathematics doesn't study some \"arbitrary\" systems of axioms, it never did and it never will. Which systems are \"good\" or \"interesting\" is discovered by trial and error, just as theoretical parts in all sciences. Sure, mathematics is unfalsifiable in the sense that if you accept the axioms (and logic) you have to accept the theorems, but Newtonian mechanics is unfalsifiable in exactly the same sense. And in the sense that it is falsifiable so is Euclidean geometry.

String theory gives a stark example of just how indirect a relation to observations and experiments can be for a vibrant physical theory.

What is the philosophical basis for such separation, is there similar separation for other sciences?

Grothendieck invented etale cohomology to prove Weil conjectures about algebraic varieties, following up on that quickly leads to tangible things as well.

I was wondering if the argumentative step from an injustice in the perfectly arranged <em>polis</em> to an injustice in a contemporary democracy  is justified somewhere. I will try to explain what I mean. Korsgaard writes (p.7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And this explains Socrates’s puzzling definition of justice. Justice, he says, is “doing one’s own work and not meddling with what isn’t one’s own” (433a–b). When Socrates first introduces this principle into the discussion (369eff.), he’s talking about the specialization of labor, and that’s what the principle sounds like it’s about. But if we think of the constitution as laying out the procedures for deliberative action, and the roles and offices that constitute those procedures, we can see what Socrates’s point is. For usurping the office of another in the constitutional procedures for collective action is precisely what we mean by injustice, or at least it is one thing we mean. For instance <strong>if the constitution says that the president cannot make war without the agreement of the congress, and yet he does, he has usurped congress’s role in this decision, and that’s unjust. If the constitution says that each citizen gets to cast one vote in the election, and through some fraud you manage to vote more than once, you are diminishing the voice of others in the election, and that’s unjust</strong>. So injustice, in one of its most familiar senses, is usurping the role of another in the deliberative procedures that define collective action. It is meddling with somebody else’s work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, considering that the <em>polis</em> Plato has in mind is arranged perfectly, and thus <em>just</em>, somebody who \"meddles with what isn't her own\" is being unjust. But having bought that, are we already, without further steps, buying that the same goes for acting against the constitution of, say, the US? Doesn't the assessment of a person's act as <em>unjust</em> mainly depend on the installation of <em>justice</em> in the society that person is acting in? For that would mean that it might not be unjust to non-conform with the constitution of an unjust society. </p>\n\n<p>If I read the following correctly, then it's not Korsgaard's goal to tell us how to behave in a society. She tells us that to conform to a constitution means to make collective action possible in the first place, and later she will, just as Plato, transfer this back to the person and its faculties/soul. Nonetheless, I wonder if her modernisation of Plato can carry the argument. Therefore the question: Is usurping the office of another in a society that might be described as not yet just <em>unjust</em> in the same way it would be in the perfect <em>polis</em>? I don't think so. </p>\n\n<p>My question would be: Does anybody know whether Korsgaard herself motivated this step somewhere else, maybe in <em>Self-Constituion: Agency, Identity, and Integrity</em>? In that case I would be grateful for a specific reference and/or an answer explaining what seems to be the argumentative gap. I would also appreciate some further references to criticisms of Korsgaard's argument.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/14031/what-was-socrates-platos-view-on-free-will","title":"What was Socrates/Plato&#39;s view on free-will?","creationDate":1402585463,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"philosophy","questionID":14031,"body":"<p>Socrates (or, rather Plato, through the voice of Socrates) leads us to the conclusion in the dialog Protagoras (<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext:1999.01.0178%3atext=Prot.%3asection=360e\">see this for example</a>) that our actions are entirely determined by our beliefs of what is the good, and our beliefs of what is the good is determined by our knowledge.

One might say that what contradiction means in epistemological terms is different from what it means ontologically. And I'm proposing that contradictions are essential epistemologically; because unlike Platonism, where truths are exhibited all at once; epistemologicaly, there are different theories, some of which whose propositions or theorems they may have in common, others may contradict.

Whitehead warns in the introduction to <em>Process and Reality</em>, that the “chief error” of Western philosophy is “overstatement.” He states: “the aim at generalization is sound, but the estimate of success is exaggerated” (<em>PR</em>, 1978, 7). Further, Whitehead is quick to point out many instances in the history of science and philosophy in which public opinion was dominated by dogmas of “misplaced concreteness,” that is abstractions or hypothetical ideas mistaken as concrete actual entities. This appears to be the common practice of scientists who believe they are on to a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) or Theory of Everything (TOE), which involves equations of strong and weak nuclear force, gravity, and quantum physics. Unlike Whitehead, they claim to speak for all epochs rather than our “immediate” one. </p>\n\n<p>But this ignores the problem of measurement and the qualifications that guide our observations and data—for Whitehead, the mathematical order full of genuine possibilities is subordinated to the act of measuring. He writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>all exact measurements concern perceptions in the mode of\n  presentational imme¬diacy [space]; and that such observations purely\n  concern the systematic geometric forms of the environment, forms\n  defined by projectors from the ‘seat’ of the strain and irrespective\n  of the actualities which constitute the environment.

All\n  scientific measurements merely concern the sys¬tematic real\n  potentiality out of which these actualities arise.

Measurement is shot through with the perception of “presentational immediacy” which “depends solely on the ‘withness’ of the ‘body,’ and only exhibits the external contemporary world in respect to its systematic geometrical relationship to the ‘body’” (<em>PR</em>, 334). Are GUT and TOE exaggerated instances of using abstractions to explain concrete relatedness?

If I make myself unclear, please let me know and I will try to describe the problem differently.</p>\n\n<p>How can I synchronize pictures with titles?</p>\n\n<p>Working fiddle: <a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/78y8n4f8/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"jsfiddle\">jsfiddle</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is my code:</p>\n\n<p>HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"news-mp-container\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"news-mp-slider\" id=\"newsMPSlider\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"images-wrapper\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"news-mp-slider-bigone\"&gt;\n                &lt;div id=\"sliderBigPhotoWrapper\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticlePhoto_101\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1426085277646_480x360.jpg\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticlePhoto_99\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1426085055263_480x360.png\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticlePhoto_98\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/142479021075_480x360.jpg\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticlePhoto_97\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1424790022510_480x360.jpg\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticlePhoto_96\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1424789916934_480x360.jpg\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticlePhoto_95\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1424789591806_480x360.png\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"news-mp-slider-thumbs\"&gt;\n                &lt;div id=\"sliderThumbsWrapper\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"news,single?id=101\" id=\"sliderArticleThumb_101\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1426085277646_62x62.jpg\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticleThumb_99\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1426085055263_62x62.png\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticleThumb_98\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/142479021075_62x62.jpg\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticleThumb_97\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1424790022510_62x62.jpg\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticleThumb_96\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1424789916934_62x62.jpg\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"sliderArticleThumb_95\"&gt;\n                        &lt;img src=\"http://magsite.pl/jsfiddleimg/articles/1424789591806_62x62.png\"/&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"news-mp-slider-title-holder\"&gt;\n            &lt;div id=\"sliderTextWrapper\"&gt;\n                &lt;div id=\"sliderArticleTitle_101\" class=\"news-mp-slider-text\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"news-mp-title\"&gt;\n                        &lt;h4&gt;Bacon ipsum&lt;/h4&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;p class=\"news-mp-shortdesc\"&gt;Bacon ipsum dolor amet kevin short ribs ham, tenderloin picanha biltong rump ribeye tail leberkas.&lt;/p&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;div id=\"sliderArticleTitle_99\" class=\"news-mp-slider-text\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"news-mp-title\"&gt;\n                        &lt;h4&gt;Lorem ipsum&lt;/h4&gt;\n                    &lt;/a&gt;\n                    &lt;p class=\"news-mp-shortdesc\"&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Each <code>FlowLayoutPanel</code> contains several other simple <code>Controls</code>, and is stored in a <code>List&lt;FlowLayoutPanel&gt;</code> named skillPanels.</p>\n\n<p>When the button is clicked to add a new <code>FlowLayoutPanel</code> to the <code>Panel</code>, one is generated and stored in skillPanels. skillPanels is then deep copied to a holder (named, err... holder), then trashed completely to get rid of the <code>FlowLayoutPanels</code> visible in the UI- every FlowLayoutPanel has its children Dispose-d, then is Disposed itself. For good measure, the List is then .Clear()-ed.</p>\n\n<p>After cleaning the slate, holder is deep copied back into skillPanels, which is then iterated over it and adds its members to the larger <code>Panel</code>, positioning each by hand as I don't trust layout managers as far as I can throw them. This level of circuitousness is sadly need for a for-each-FlowLayoutPanel remove method that will be added in the future. By stepping through the code and providing <code>MessageBoxes</code>, I know for certain that each one is added to the larger <code>Panel</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But here's the kicker: despite <code>.Add</code>-ing to the <code>Panel</code>, only some of them show up. I suspect the <code>.Dispose</code> method is to blame somehow, but I can't explain how or why.</p>\n\n<p>For my own sanity, as well as a degree of clarity, this is the pattern of which <code>FlowLayoutPanel</code> is visible after which clicks:</p>\n\n<p>1st add: 1</p>\n\n<p>2nd add: 2 (i.e. 1 has disappeared)</p>\n\n<p>3rd add: 2, 3</p>\n\n<p>4th add: 2, 4</p>\n\n<p>5th add: 2, 4, 5</p>\n\n<p>6th add: 4, 6</p>\n\n<p>7th add: 4, 6, 7</p>\n\n<p>8th add: 6, 8</p>\n\n<p>9th add: 6, 8, 9</p>\n\n<p>See a pattern forming?</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing System.Data;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nnamespace WindowsFormsApplication1\n{\n    public partial class Form1 : Form\n    {\n        List&lt;FlowLayoutPanel&gt; skillPanels = new List&lt;FlowLayoutPanel&gt;();\n\n        public Form1()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n        }\n\n        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            Panel pnlMacroSkillsPanel = new Panel();\n            pnlMacroSkillsPanel.Height = this.Height;\n            pnlMacroSkillsPanel.Width = this.Width;\n            Button btnAddSkill = new Button();\n            btnAddSkill.Click += new EventHandler(btnAddSkill_Click);\n            pnlMacroSkillsPanel.Controls.Add(btnAddSkill);\n            this.Controls.Add(pnlMacroSkillsPanel);            \n        }\n\n        void reDrawSkillPanels(Panel pan)\n        {\n            FlowLayoutPanel plato = new FlowLayoutPanel();\n            List&lt;FlowLayoutPanel&gt; holder = new List&lt;FlowLayoutPanel&gt;(skillPanels.Count);\n            foreach (FlowLayoutPanel f in skillPanels)\n            {\n                holder.Add(f);\n            }\n            try\n            {\n                foreach (object f in pan.Controls)\n                {\n                    if (f is FlowLayoutPanel)\n                    {\n                        plato = (FlowLayoutPanel)f;\n                        MessageBox.Show(\"Disposing of FlowLayoutPanel\");\n                        foreach (Control c in plato.Controls)\n                        {\n                            c.Dispose();\n                        }\n                        ((FlowLayoutPanel)f).Dispose();\n                    }\n                }\n                skillPanels.Clear();\n            }\n            catch (Exception e)\n            {\n                //\n            }\n            foreach (FlowLayoutPanel f in holder)\n            {\n                skillPanels.Add(f);\n            }\n            holder.Clear();\n            int initialYoffset = 40;\n            for (int count = 0; count &lt; skillPanels.Count; count++)\n            {\n                plato = new FlowLayoutPanel();\n                plato = skillPanels[count];\n                plato.Top = initialYoffset + ((plato.Height + 4) * count);\n                plato.Left = 4;\n                //MessageBox.Show(\"Adding skillPanels member at: 4, \" + (initialYoffset + ((skillPanels[count].Height + 4) * count)) + \"!\");\n                //MessageBox.Show(\"ToString:\" + skillPanels[count].ToString() + \", Width: \" + skillPanels[count].Width);\n                pan.Controls.Add(plato);\n            }\n            //MessageBox.Show(\"skillPanels.Count = \" + skillPanels.Count);\n        }\n\n        void btnAddSkill_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            Button plato = (Button)sender;\n            FlowLayoutPanel pnlNewSkill = new FlowLayoutPanel\n            pnlNewSkill.FlowDirection = FlowDirection.LeftToRight;\n            pnlNewSkill.Height = 30;\n            pnlNewSkill.Width = 350;\n            Random r = new Random();\n            Color randomColor = Color.FromArgb(r.Next(255), r.Next(255), r.Next(255));\n            pnlNewSkill.BackColor = randomColor;\n            /*\n             * Code creating and adding Controls to pnlNewPanel would go here\n             */\n            skillPanels.Add(pnlNewSkill);\n            reDrawSkillPanels(((Panel)(plato.Parent)));\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25379123/publishing-plato-reports-with-jenkins","title":"Publishing Plato reports with Jenkins","creationDate":1408437904,"checked":false,"isBad":true,"isGood":false,"site":"stackoverflow","questionID":25379123,"body":"<p>I haven't been able to find any Jenkins plugins for publishing Plato reports (it doesn't seem to Google well).

Included are things like tests with jasmine, code checking with plato, documentation (YUIdoc) and so on...</p>\n\n<p>To make things a bit more convenient (and also to include this build process into another build process later) I tried to create a simple .net (C#) application that is able to execute the grunt commands and then outputs the results into a textbox. As I can always execute the grunt commands easily via the cmd-Window I tried utilizing <strong>System.Diagnostics.Process</strong> with <strong>cmd.exe</strong> to do that. Here is what I tried (for generating the code documentation):</p>\n\n<pre><code>private void documentationToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    Process p = new Process();\n    p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;\n    p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;\n    p.StartInfo.WindowStyle = System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle.Normal;\n    p.StartInfo.FileName = \"cmd.exe\";\n    p.StartInfo.Arguments = \"/C grunt doc\";\n    p.StartInfo.WorkingDirectory = \"c:\\\\myProjectFolder\\\\\";\n    p.Start();\n\n    p.WaitForExit();\n    rtbOut.Text = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First thing which is weired: I am getting this output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;Loading \"requirejs.js\" tasks...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Yes, I do use require.js inside my project but this has nothing to do with documentation. This is the output I usually get and I would expect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;Running \"doc\" task\n&gt;\n&gt;Running \"yuidoc:compile\" (yuidoc) task\n&gt;Start YUIDoc compile...\n&gt;Scanning: ../someFolder/\n&gt;Output: ../release/Documentation/\n&gt;YUIDoc compile completed in 0.968 seconds\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the documentation is not generated of course. But there is a <em>data.json</em> File which is generated in the correct folder but it is empty. So at least it appears that it started correctly but could not continue(?) I also tried with other tasks but none of them work using a Process in C#.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25231339/iscroll-4-doesnt-back-to-the-top-after-change-page","title":"iScroll 4 doesn`t back to the top after change page","creationDate":1407692551,"checked":false,"isBad":true,"isGood":false,"site":"stackoverflow","questionID":25231339,"body":"<p>Im using iscroll4. when Im scrolling the page1 to the bottom then change to next page2, and again back to the page1 the scrolling position is the same.

There are nearer approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the highest point (cp, especially in Books V, VI, VII) to which ancient thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth; and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized. He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, the law of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary and unnecessary—these and other great forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were probably first invented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference between words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on by him (cp. Rep.; Polit.; Cratyl), although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings (e.g. Rep.). But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae,—logic is still veiled in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to 'contemplate all truth and all existence' is very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered (Soph. Elenchi).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20643361/remove-rows-from-data-frame-if-values-added-together-is-less-than-x","title":"Remove rows from data frame if values added together is less than x","creationDate":1387309791,"checked":false,"isBad":true,"isGood":false,"site":"stackoverflow","questionID":20643361,"body":"<p>I have the following data frame, call it df, which is a data frame consisting in three vectors: \"Scene,\" \"Name,\" and \"Appearances.\"  I would like to total the value for \"Appearances\" for every instance in which the \"Name\" is in the list and divide it by the number of times the name appears in the list.

Celebrations and suppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found a place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date of Mary Antrim’s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say that this occasion kept him: it kept him at least effectually from doing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of which time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his feast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his marriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the matter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no bridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day had been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection that promised to fill his life to the brim.\"</p>\n\n<p>Sample text 3 from Mark Twain's \"ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER\"</p>\n\n<p>\" The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \"style,\" not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear:</p>\n\n<p>\"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—\"</p>\n\n<p>She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.</p>\n\n<p>\"I never did see the beat of that boy!\"</p>\n\n<p>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and \"jimpson\" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:</p>\n\n<p>\"Y-o-u-u TOM!\"</p>\n\n<p>There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.</p>\n\n<p>\"There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in there?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Nothing.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth.

The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.”</p>\n\n<p>Then another drop fell.</p>\n\n<p>“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I must look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.</p>\n\n<p>But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw— Ah! what did he see?</p>\n\n<p>The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.</p>\n\n<p>“Who are you?” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“I am the Happy Prince.”</p>\n\n<p>“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched me.” \"</p>\n\n<p>Sample text 5 from Plato's \"Laws\"</p>\n\n<p>\" MEGILLUS: I think that I can get as far as the fourth head, which is the frequent endurance of pain, exhibited among us Spartans in certain hand-to-hand fights; also in stealing with the prospect of getting a good beating; there is, too, the so-called Crypteia, or secret service, in which wonderful endurance is shown,—our people wander over the whole country by day and by night, and even in winter have not a shoe to their foot, and are without beds to lie upon, and have to attend upon themselves. Marvellous, too, is the endurance which our citizens show in their naked exercises, contending against the violent summer heat; and there are many similar practices, to speak of which in detail would be endless.</p>\n\n<p>ATHENIAN: Excellent, O Lacedaemonian Stranger.

FooFragment, BarFragment, etc) it's very useful to identify and retrieve an active fragment of a specific type.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object getActiveFragmentOfType(Class&lt;?&gt; cls) {\n    List&lt;Fragment&gt; frags = getActiveFragments();\n    for(Fragment one : frags) {\n        if(cls.isInstance(one)) {\n            return one;\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then when I want to work on a specific tab/fragment/class I just do something like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object fooFragmentObject = getActiveFragmentOfType(FooFragment.class);\nif(fooFragmentObject != null) {\n    // Do something with an active reference to fooFragmentObject that's\n    // guaranteed to be castable to FooFragment\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"link":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17196383/searching-table-view-with-subtitles-in-cells","title":"Searching Table View with Subtitles in Cells","creationDate":1371658929,"checked":false,"isBad":true,"isGood":false,"site":"stackoverflow","questionID":17196383,"body":"<p>I have a table view and can search for the titles.  I'm wanting to add subtitles to the cells, which I know how to do, but I'd like to be able to search by info in the subtitles as wells as titles.  The index of each item in the subtitles array, corresponds to the object at the same index in the title array.  So, one problem I have is, when I search and the table view auto updates according to the search text, I need to have the correct subtitle show with it.  The same thing would need to be done if I search for text that is in the subtitle.  It would need to show the correct title for the subtitle.
