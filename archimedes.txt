Of all the examples the Archimedes Cattle Problem is the only one that was truly proposed and solved. The oracle of Delphi allegedly \"proposed\" duplication to the Athenians, but it could not have been very precise since they originally took it to mean doubling the sides. Who proposed quadrature and trisection is hidden in the mists of time (in a practical context <a href=\"http://www-math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/history2/quad.pdf\">finding the area of a circle already appears as problem 50 in the Rhind papyrus c. 1600 BC</a>), but they apparently did not specify that it had to be done with straightedge and compass either, because all three were solved within a hundred years of being \"proposed\" by other means (e.g. <a href=\"http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dinostratus.html\">quadrature was solved by Dinostratus c. 350 BC, using quadratrix</a>). And one has to be really precise, because already Archimedes knew how to solve duplication and trisection with marked straightedge and compass. </p>\n\n<p>That with such precise restrictions there were no solutions was suspected in late antiquity, as follows from <a href=\"http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Pappus.html\">Pappus's classification of problems into plane (solved with straightedge and compass), solid (solved with conic sections), and other</a>, but the idea of proving something like that does not emerge as a problem until 17th century, when <a href=\"https://hal-insu.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01098493/document\">Gregory attempted proving the impossibility of quadrature in 1667</a>. So what was \"solved\" in 1837 and 1882 is not what was \"proposed\" in 5th century BC.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Euclid did not \"propose\" to derive the parallel postulate from other postulates, although many took his verbose phrasing and avoiding the use of it for half of book I as an invitation to do so. Fermat did not propose the Last Theorem as a problem either, he stated it, and mentioned  on the margins of his copy of Diophantus's Arithmetica that he \"discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain\". Only later Euler and others realized that something was amiss when they tried to reproduce this \"marvelous proof\". It is more accurate to say that all these problems, as we know them today, emerged over time from multiple people playing with a common theme.</p>\n\n<p>But this is Guinness Book of Records, so we shouldn't be too picky. In which case <a href=\"http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Perfect_numbers.html\">Pythagoreans already cared about perfect numbers</a> in 6th century BC, Euclid gives a familiar characterization of them in Elements IX.36 (c.300 BC). They probably wondered if there is the largest among them, Euclid answers such question about primes in Elements IX.20, Nichomachus implied the same answer for perfects c. 100 AD. In any case this is what emerged after centuries of playing with them, so the problem \"originates\" before all of the above, and it is still open.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/2002/how-did-royal-we-become-a-standard-of-scientific-writing","title":"How did &quot;royal we&quot; become a standard of scientific writing?","creationDate":1424660275,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"hsm","questionID":2002,"body":"<p>Single authors referring to themselves as \"we\" is still commonplace today, and already Newton was we-ing in Principia.

His calculations were off, mostly due to the difficulty in perceiving the variation of shadow on the Moon to Earth, but his method was both sound and reproducible.

In Europe this series was rediscovered by Leibniz, and is usually called Leibniz series in Western literature.</p>\n\n<p>A semi-geometric \"calculation\" procedure capable in principle of producing arbitrary accuracy is much older. It consists of approximating a circle by inscribed and circumscribed polygons, and can be traced to ancient Greek orator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphon_%28orator%29#Mathematics\">Antiphon the Sophist</a>. This method was mathematically justified by <a href=\"http://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/masters/Greek/eudoxus.pdf\">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a> using what is now called method of exhaustion, and his justification is presented in <a href=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXII/propXII2.html\">Book XII</a> of Euclid's Elements. Archimedes perfected the method in <a href=\"http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/math300/07f/archcircle.pdf\">On the Measurement of the Circle</a>. He proved rigorously that the ratio of the circle to the square on its radius was the same as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, so it could be computed both ways. Approximating circumference with polygon perimeters is much simpler than circle area with polygon areas as Antiphon did. Using $96$-gons Archimedes obtained what is now presented as the double estimate $3\\frac{10}{71}&lt;\\pi&lt;3\\frac17$, although to Archimedes $\\pi$ was not a number and the result was phrased geometrically in terms of <a href=\"http://www.lamath.org/journal/vol5no2/Ratio_Proportion.pdf\">ratios of magnitudes</a>.

A geometric magnitude was considered \"calculated\" if one could give a geometric construction for it. In case of $\\pi$ this meant constructing a square with area equal to the area of a given circle (or, after Archimedes, a segment with length equal to half the circle's circumference). With straightedge and compass this is impossible (but it was only shown by Lindeman in 19th century), but Greeks entertained a more broad notion of \"construction\". In this sense the circle was first squared by <a href=\"http://www.educ.fc.ul.pt/icm/icm2003/icm14/Dinostratus.htm\">Dinostratus</a> around 350 BC using a curve, now known as <a href=\"http://www.ms.uky.edu/~carl/ma330/hippias/hippias2.html\">quadratrix</a>. The curve itself was invented a century earlier by Hippias, who generated it by combining uniform linear and circular motions. In modern terms from a segment of length $1$ it produces (\"calculates\") a segment of length $2/\\pi$, and from that it is a simple matter to get a segment of length $\\pi$ with straightedge and compass.

The page <a href=\"http://mathpages.com/home/kmath038/kmath038.htm\">Archimedes and the Square Root of 3</a> lists several such.  This example, attributed to W.W. Rouse Ball, is typical:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It would seem...that [Archimedes] had some (at present unknown) method of extracting the square root of numbers approximately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To my mind, there is a very easy answer to this seeming puzzle.  If you want rational approximations to $\\sqrt 3$, the <em>very simplest</em> thing you can possibly do is as follows:  You want to find integers $a$ and $b$ whose ratio is close to $\\sqrt 3$, or equivalently you want to find $a^2$ and $b^2$ whose ratio is close to $3$.  So you should tabulate $n^2$ and $3n^2$ and look for integers in the left column that are approximately equal to integers in the right column:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\begin{array}{rrr}\nn &amp; n^2 &amp; 3n^2 \\\\ \\hline\n1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\color{darkgreen}{3} \\\\\n2 &amp; \\color{darkgreen}{4} &amp; 12 \\\\\n3 &amp; 9 &amp; \\color{darkred}{27} \\\\\n4 &amp; 16 &amp; \\color{darkblue}{48} \\\\\n5 &amp; \\color{darkred}{25} &amp; 75 \\\\\n6 &amp; 36 &amp; 108 \\\\\n7 &amp; \\color{darkblue}{49} &amp; 147 \\\\\n8 &amp; 64 &amp; 192 \\\\\n9 &amp; 81 &amp; 243 \\\\\n10 &amp; 100 &amp; 300 \\\\\n11 &amp; 121 &amp; \\color{purple}{363} \\\\\n\\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\\n19 &amp; \\color{purple}{361} &amp; 1183 \\\\\n\\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>The pairs of colored entries give the approximations $\\color{green}{\\frac21}, \\color{maroon}{\\frac53}, \\color{darkblue}{\\frac74},  $ and $\\color{purple}{\\frac{19}{11}}$ respectively.  If you carry the table to 265 entries, you find that $265^2 = 70225$ and $3\\cdot 153^2 = 70227$ and there is your $\\sqrt 3 \\approx \\frac{265}{153}$.  You don't have to be as clever as Archimedes to think of this. No magical technique was required, no sophisticated theory was required.  The calculation is tedious but straightforward and I judge that it could have been carried to 265 entries in at most a few hours, even using whatever awful technology was available at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Archimedes  might, of course, have used a better method.  (He also produces the approximation  $\\frac{1351}{780}$, for which the foregoing is not obviously practical. He might have deployed the so-called “Babylonian method”. Or, having  tabulated the first few approximations from from the table above, he might have noticed the simple recurrence that governs them; this would not be hard for a bright high-school student. Or he might have had a some other method.) But it seems to me that since there is a straightforward and simple method by which Archimedes could have produced the required approximations, there is no puzzle to solve. </p>\n\n<p>However, Rouse Ball and a number of other eminent authors disagree with me, and consider Archimedes' calculation of $\\sqrt 3\\approx \\frac{265}{153}$  to be mysterious. (The page I linked earlier cites: T. Heath, E.T. Bell, C.B. Boyer, M. Kline, P. Beckmann, Sondheimer and Rogerson, and goes on to describe a complicated and elaborate method that Archimedes could have used.) </p>\n\n<p>If it was only popular mathematics authors who thought this calculation required  mysterious powers on the part of Archimedes, I would write it off as the authors overlooking the obvious, because the authors of popular books on mathematics can be quite obtuse.

Why? Did he doubt it? It's not like Euclid was a formalist, in the very first proof of <a href=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI1.html\">proposition I.1</a> (construction of equilateral triangle), he freely concludes from the diagram that two circles with common interior points intersect at two points. This is called <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/000298910X480063\">circle-cirle axiom</a> by Greenberg and is not a postulate. Why is intersection of two circles \"self-evident\", but (effectively) intersection of two convergent lines is not? Nor does Euclid complicate the first postulate by stipulating uniqueness of a line through two points, even though it is clear from his proofs that he assumes it. The second postulate is also weaker than what Euclid actually uses.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, with parallels Euclid is very pedantic, as if trying to attract attention to them: \n\"<em>If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>Some textbooks blame other instances on Euclid's \"flaws\" and \"gaps\", but this is apparently a <a href=\"http://fitelson.org/few/few_07/mumma.pdf\">modernization</a> based on reading Pasch and Hilbert into Euclid. Euclid's method was not axiomatic, it was synthetic. In other words, when he gives a geometric construction he accepts non-deductive conclusions \"from the diagram\", as long as the conclusions would follow from any possible diagram consistent with the construction. Listed postulates were the ones most commonly used and/or most \"subtle\" perhaps? In principle there was no need to list the parallel postulate at all, like Euclid didn't list the circle-circle or the uniqueness of the line. </p>\n\n<p>Even if Euclid did want to list something about parallels he could opt for <a href=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI30.html\">I.30</a> instead, two lines parallel to a third are parallel to each other. Much simpler. The contrapositive to this (two intersecting lines can not both be parallel to a third) is now well known and used as \"Playfair's axiom\". Even assuming that Euclid didn't know that it was equivalent, Ptolemy showed it explicitly later, according to Proclus, but that was not deemed satisfactory. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Proof attempts continued for over a thousand years.

Why?</p>\n</blockquote>\n","isAnswered":true,"answer":"<p>The reasons are \"simple\". \nAll other axioms and postulates appeal to our \"everyday experience\",\nat least in principle. The straight lines correspond to light rays in everyday experience.\nHowever it was probably already recognized by Euclid, that the parallel postulate is different from the other axioms. Of course, a degree of mathematical sophistication\nis required to understand this. But probably Euclid already understood this.\nEven when stated accurately, the V postulate looks much more complicated than the other axioms and postulates. </p>\n\n<p>How indeed would you verify it experimentally? The postulate itself, or any of its immediate consequences. One of the simplest consequences is that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles. How can you verify that this holds in real life?\nNo measurement, no matter how accurate will show you this.</p>\n\n<p>Gauss and Lobachevski, who recognized that the postulate does not follow from the rest of the axioms, indeed discuss its possible experimental verification. One has to measure the angles of a very large triangle to do this. And any result that you obtain will have some error in the measurement, and leave the possibility that if you take a larger triangle,\nyou will see that the sum is not equal to two right angles. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT. To obtain a better intuitive understanding what the axioms mean, imagine that you live in a world in which one of the axioms is not satisfied, and explore how different this word looks. For example, suppose that two light rays can intersect at two points.\nThis means that under certain conditions you will see the same object as two objects. Our \neveryday\nexperience shows that this is not the case in our world. </p>\n\n<p>Now imagine a world where the parallel postulate does not hold. Will you see something peculiar in your everyday life? The answer is \"no\". Everything will look more or less the same. Until you start measuring the angles of large triangles.

However, the  Antikythera mechanism (dated to 150-100 BC) has an epicyclic gear for the lunar motion, so under the conventional timeline there are two problems with this idea.</p>\n\n<p>The first problem is Apollonius. In Almagest XII,1 Ptolemy credits him with proving theorems about epicycles, and this seems to be the earliest association of epicycles with anybody's name. Some biographers <a href=\"http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Apollonius.html\">say</a> that \"the theory of epicycles certainly predates Apollonius\", but I am not sure where this \"certainly\" comes from.</p>\n\n<p>The second problem is Hipparchus. Even Apollonius is only credited with theorems, Hipparchus (again according to Ptolemy) was the first one to apply epicycles to lunar motion, and he did it based on Babylonian data, which Archimedes presumably didn't have a century earlier. By the way, Hipparchus lived around the time the Antikythera was made. However, a gear similar to Antikythera's, but dated to before Hipparchus (200-150 BC), was <a href=\"http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2012/2012-01-14.html\">found</a> in a shipwreck that can be linked directly to Syracuse, and hence to Archimedes.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if Archimedes did not use epicycles the only model available to him would have been of Eudoxian homocentric spheres. According to <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41134047\">modern reconstructions</a> (p.226) reproducing the uneven motion of the Moon even crudely (and predicting eclipses mentioned by Cicero) would require at least three spheres rotating at different speeds under different inclinations, and with outer spheres transferring motion to inner spheres to combine it with their internal rotations. Even more spheres are required to reproduce retrogressions of the planets.</p>\n\n<p>Ptolemy is not exactly a great authority on historical matters (he managed to mention no astronomer between himself and Hipparchus, a span of over 200 years), and his attributions to Apollonius and Hipparchus were specifically <a href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~brg/pdfs/brg_v_3.pdf\">questioned</a> by some scholars. Life dates of Archimedes (287-212 BC) and Apollonius (262-190 BC) overlap, and we know that both corresponded with Alexandrians, at least two of which, Eratothenes and Aristarchus, performed astronomical measurements (Archimedes wrote to Eratothenes and mentioned Aristarchus in Sand Reckoner). Finally, some arrangements of Eudoxian spheres are <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41134047\">suggestive</a> (p. 227) of the simpler epicyclic scheme.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it plausible in the light of recent developments that Archimedes/Alexandrians already developed epicyclic models of the Moon (and possibly planets) a century before Hipparchus?

Just like the case where you may consider it to be a part of the vessel itself.</p></li>\n</ol>\n","isAnswered":true,"answer":"<ol>\n<li>The reason behind buoyancy is the pressure difference in fluids. More specifically, the difference in hydrostatic pressure on different levels, since the hydrostatic pressure of water increases with depth ($p=\\rho gh$ wher $h$ is the distance below the surface). The part of the body which is subject to higher hydrostatic pressure will be pushed more upwards than the part of the body subject to lower hydrostatic pressure will be pushed downwards. Also, in space there would be no buoyancy because there would be no gravity, hence no difference in hydrostatic pressure.</li>\n<li>The answer is actually A. Since, as you said, no water gets below the cube, there will be no force directed upwards due to pressure. The liquid will actually push the cube downwards, to the floor, so the force on the bottom of the vessel in contact with the cube will be the cube's weight + the weight of the liquid above.</li>\n<li>Yes, since the reason behind buoyancy is the pressure difference, if there's no water below the cube, there will actually be no buoyant force. The liquid will push the cube downwards.</li>\n<li>I would argue that the cube does actually displace water (if you removed it, the water level would decline), but in this case you're right when you treat it as a part of the vessel, since there's no water below it. Every body immersed in a fluid will displace some part of it (because the fluid was there in the first place, when you immersed the body it had to go somewhere), but the Archimedes principle saying the force on the body will be equal to the weight of the displaced fluid is only right when the body is completely immersed in it. Actually, the derivation of this law is fairly simple:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let's consider a volume of water $V$, let it be in the shape of, for instance, a potato. The water is subject to two forces: its weight and the buoyant force. Since it doesn't move, we conclude that the buoyant force is equal the the weight of $V$ of water. Now, let's say we displace the water with a potato of the same shape and volume $V$ - it occupies exactly the same space as the water discussed. Since the buoyant force is the result of the difference in pressure and does not depend on any characteristics of the body, it will be exactly the same as it was with the water volume. That's because the pressure around the body doesn't change. That's why we conclude the bouyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/149669/possible-solutions-to-the-crown-problem-of-archimedes","title":"Possible solutions to the crown problem of Archimedes","creationDate":1417368029,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"physics","questionID":149669,"body":"<p>My teacher was talking about the crown problem, possibly solved by Archimedes using skills about density, weight and other properties that he studied.

Take a small piece of gold and a small piece of the object to be tested for gold purity. Place them in different crucibles and SLOWLY start increasing the heat. If the object is pure gold, it should melt 100% when the piece of pure gold melts. If it melts at more or less heat than the pure gold piece then it definitely contains impurities.</p>\n\n<p>2- Gold and silver have different densities but you can utilise the density idea other than water displacement method too. Simply take a piece of pure gold and the object to be tested. Now take a large glass jar of at least 3 feet depth. Fill 90% with clean, clear water. Now slowly release both of them (pure gold piece and the crown) in the water.

That issue set aside, our analysis is weak on a few points.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First, you used only one density, $\\rho$, where there in fact are two densities involved, the one of the cold (ambient) air and of the hot air flowing through the pipe. As I understand your question, that difference in density is the whole point of having gases with different temperatures.</li>\n<li>What you calculated in Method 1 is the buoyant force of the hot gas expelled in one second. It is highly non-trivial how the expelled gas will flow once it left the pipe, but at some point it will \"turn around\" and head upwards. This depends on the velocity $v$ but also on things like the viscosity of the air (at different temperatures!). In terms of energy though, no constant power has to be provided to accomplish this once some equilibrium situation is reached. When you turn on the air flow or vary its velocity, the amount of displaced cold air will vary and you'd have to pay energy for that but you do not have to pay any more energy once this is accomplished. (Remember: work is force integrated over distance).</li>\n<li>In Method 2 you're viewing the situation as some sort of rocket which produces thrust by expelling hot gas. This is an entirely different situation as it makes no reference to buoyancy whatsoever. Indeed, the \"rocket\" would still work in the absence of gravity (which is why rockets are used in space). That tells you that the two methods are not different ways of calculating the same thing but are just different effects. But still I claim there will be no net force if the system is somehow closed, i.e. if the hot air expelled at the bottom is somehow sucked in at the top.</li>\n<li>What we haven't dealt with so far is also the equilibration of temperature. This depends on so many things like thermal conductivity, but also on the hydrodynamic motion (how fast will the gases mix), the viscosity, the diffusion constant -- if you know the properties of air very well, you might be able to do a simulation of it, but I don't think you can quantify this effect reliably otherwise. </li>\n<li>Finally, the issue I've been dancing around so far: energy and power. What do you actually mean by that? As stated above, you'd have to invest energy to get things flowing in the first place but then there is not energy to invest other than what you need to keep the temperature difference up (i.e. to fight the equilibration of temperature) and to account for losses due to internal friction. It's like stiring with a spoon in a cup of coffee. Once you set the circulation in motion, you can take out the spoon and it will continue to circulate and will only stop due to internal friction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>IMO, the upshot is this: the power you have to put in is really difficult to quantify. Simple considerations of buoyancy won't get you anywhere, neither will the rocket analogy. More to the point: the two methods you laid out are different effects and are certainly not expected to give the same result.

I think it's only the displacement thing that's working here because I tried putting the finger in the water faster, and the effect was pretty much the same except I spilled a lot of water trying different things. </p>\n\n<p>But I don't get it why after the water has formed this something like a wall around my finger (not that I can see this moment; it's too quick), the wall starts to move towards the rim. Why doesn't the water just flow down the wall, like dry sand flows down a sand wall? Then I think the excess water should spread itself over the surface, but it doesn't do that. So how does this work?</p>\n","isAnswered":true,"answer":"<p>When you first put your finger into the water, the situation is pretty much as you describe; the water is not solid and so the molecules <em>can</em> move, unlike those of your finger or the bowl, so they <em>must</em> move (no two atoms can be in exactly the same place at exactly the same time). Liquids are classically defined as incompressible (technically most liquids including water <em>can</em> be compressed, but the ratio of force to volume is <em>much</em> greater than with a gas), so not only must the water molecules move, they must push all the other water molecules out of the way instead of simply getting closer to them. However, air, a gas, <em>can</em> move and <em>can</em> compress, so initially it is easier for the water to move up against the air than out against more water to get out of the way of your finger.</p>\n\n<p>That's what happens in the first fractions of a second after your finger enters. What happens next involves some very complex math, but the concept is still simple; while water is incompressible, it is still a fluid, and so as gravity pulls on all the water molecules, those molecules move around each other trying to reach a new equilibrium between the force of gravity and the forces exerted by all the other molecules of water. In short, the surface of the water wants to settle down to a new \"level\". The water that moved up when you inserted your finger now tries to move back down, pulled by gravity. That pushes other water molecules aside, just as your finger did, and with a similar result; some of them find it easier to go up than out. This process repeats itself over time, with the result that a wave of water is generated as water molecules get out of the way of other molecules and then settle. When this wave hits the edges of the bowl, well, that's a solid surface that won't move, so the water can't move out, so it moves up again, and then when it settles there's only one way the water can push and that's back in the opposite direction.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the second law of thermodynamics states that \"you can't get the same energy out of a system that you put in\"; even at the molecular level, there is \"friction\", where molecules will simply absorb the energy as heat instead of moving. In addition, as waves bounce around the edges of the bowl, they meet, and when the crest of the wave meets a trough, the two cancel out (the sum of the energies of the peak and trough of a waveform of given amplitude is zero). Eventually, the waves cancel out enough that the water molecules themselves simply absorb the energy and do not move (perceptibly) at all, and the system has then reached its new resting state.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/4831/how-long-would-a-lever-have-to-be-to-move-the-planet-earth","title":"How long would a lever have to be to move the planet Earth?","creationDate":1297201671,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"physics","questionID":4831,"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Give me a lever long enough and a\n  fulcrum on which to place it, and I\n  shall move the world.\n                <br>-Archimedes</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How long would that lever have to be?</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, how long a lever would be needed on Earth, to lift a sphere with the mass of Earth if a human of average size were to sit on the other side of the lever?</p>\n","isAnswered":true,"answer":"<p>The mass of Earth is $6\\times10^{24}kg$.

As an alternative, I made a proof involving infinite sums of the lateral areas of cylinders squeezed into a sphere.

Strangely, another \"proof\" I did also led to this result. Take the semicircle $y = \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$ with arclength $\\pi r$ and rotate it about the x axis $2\\pi$ radians. We now have a sphere, with surface area $2\\pi^2 r^2$. Something is clearly wrong here, but it gets stranger.

Thanks for reading all the way through this, and does anyone know how I messed up?</p>\n","isAnswered":true,"answer":"<p>One thing that's true about volume but not surface area (or, down a dimension, true about area but not perimeter) is that if shape $A$ contains shape $B$, then $A$ has a larger volume than $B$. In symbols:\n$$A\\supseteq B\\implies\\operatorname{volume}(A)\\ge\\operatorname{volume}(B)$$\nThis means that it's fairly easy to approximate volumes — just find the volume of something that contains $A$ to get an upper bound, and find the volume of something that's contained in $A$ to get a lower bound. Now, to get the volume exactly: if we can get better and better approximations, then we can just take the limit as the two approximations get increasingly better. Hopefully, they approach the same limit (call it $a$) — and, except for weird cases, they usually do approach the same limit — so we have that the volume of $A$ is bounded above <em>and</em> below by $a$. That is, $a\\le\\operatorname{volume}(A)\\le a$. Thus, we have that the volume is exactly $a$.</p>\n\n<p>This all goes out the window with surface area. Let's say $A$ is a smooth shape, and $B$ is some really spiky thing contained in $A$. Now, it's entirely possible that $B$ has a larger surface area than $A$. So we get no upper or lower bounds. This means that we have no reason to expect our approximations to be accurate whatsoever. And, as you've found out, they aren't always accurate.</p>\n\n<p>There is a way to save this. If $A$ and $B$ are both convex, then we <em>do</em> have that $A$ has a larger surface area than $B$, and our approximations <em>do</em> work. And we <em>can</em> use limits to get the volume exactly. However, I'm pretty sure your union of cylinders isn't convex.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1387028/space-capsule-volume-of-revolution","title":"Space capsule volume of revolution","creationDate":1438888323,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"math","questionID":1387028,"body":"<p>We are contracting you to help design a space capsule for NASA that will orbit the earth and eventually re-enter the atmosphere and splash down in the Indian Ocean.

I decided to write my own proof similar to the one in the book, which I found too complicated to really understand (not logically, but just motivation wise because he doesn't explain things like how you can think of $1^2+2^2+\\cdots+(n-1)^2 &lt; n^3/3 &lt; 1^2+2^2+\\cdots+n^2$ and it just seems like he pulled a rabbit out of the hat when he states this inequality).</p>\n\n<p>My main question is whether my proof is rigorous. Here goes:</p>\n\n<p>We want to find the area of the parabola that has an ordinate $ax^2+c$ at $x$. We want to find this area from $x=0$ to $x=b$. So first we find upper and lower bounds, $\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n-1)+\\frac{(n-1)bc}{n}&lt;A&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n)+bc$ where $A$ is the area. This must be true for all $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. Our plan is simple: We try to \"build\" this inequality from a \"primitive\" inequality for which we know the middle term. In this way, if we can make the middle term constant at some step in the manipulation, and keep it constant, then by comparison we will know $A$. This is because, we will have an inequality of the form $\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n-1)+\\frac{(n-1)bc}{n}&lt;C&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n)+bc$ for some constant $C$, and this will be true for all $n$. Therefore, since the area of a parabolic segment cannot have two values from $x=0$ to $x=b$, it must be that $A=C$, and we will know $A$ since we know $C$.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what can this \"primitive inequality\" that we talked about look like. Well, it must be true for all $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, so that when we manipulate it into the desired form we end up with the \"$C$\" inequality being true for all $n$. Therefore it must be an inequality in $n$.</p>\n\n<p>Also we see $f(n-1)$ and $f(n)$. Eventually therefore we might be led to consider the primitive inequality $f(n-1)&lt;g(n)&lt;f(n)$ for some function $g(n)$. We know that we must multiply this through by $\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}$. We also know that we want $g(n)$ to be constant after this multiplication. Thus we consider $g(n)=kn^3$ for some constant $k$. It is easy to find therefore that $k=1/3$; indeed $f(n-1)&lt;n^3/3&lt;f(n)$ is true for all $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. Now we start:</p>\n\n<p>Multplying through by $\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}$ gives $\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n-1)&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{3}&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n)$ (the middle term constant like we wanted), then we add $bc$ to both sides rather than $\\frac{(n-1)bc}{n}$ (to keep the middle term constant) to get $\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n-1)+bc&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{3}+bc&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n)+bc$. Finally we see that $\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n-1)+\\frac{(n-1)bc}{n}&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n-1)+bc$ so that the last inequality becomes $\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n-1)+\\frac{(n-1)bc}{n}&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{3}+bc&lt;\\frac{ab^3}{n^3}f(n)+bc$. So by comparison with the original inequality, we see that $A=\\frac{ab^3}{3}+bc$ and we are done.</p>\n","isAnswered":false},{"link":"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1371668/equation-to-place-points-equidistantly-on-an-archimedian-spiral-using-arc-length","title":"Equation to place points equidistantly on an Archimedian Spiral using arc-length","creationDate":1437676319,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"math","questionID":1371668,"body":"<p>I am looking for a way to place points equidistantly along an Archimedes spiral according to arch-length (or an approximation) given the following parameters:</p>\n\n<p>Max Radius,\nFixed distance between the points,\nNumber of points</p>\n\n<p>I have been lurking around on this site for a few days and have found a lot of great advice but am struggling with the syntax of some of the proposed responses (not a native coder but I have had small exposure to Python and Matlab).</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13894715/draw-equidistant-points-on-a-spiral\">example 1</a> seems to be exactly what I am looking for but I am just struggling with the code, it is not clear to me what variables are used or how the program executes. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/81636/how-to-place-objects-equidistantly-on-an-archimedean-spiral\">Example 2</a> and <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/877044/keeping-the-arc-length-constant-between-points-in-a-spiral\">example 3</a> were also helpful but I am definitely missing something when it comes to solving the equation numerically as the resulting spiral does not have equal spacing.</p>\n\n<p>My goal is to use a spreadsheet (MS Excel) to drive a solid modeling program to generate a hole pattern per the parameters above. </p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n","isAnswered":true,"answer":"<p>If the polar equation of an Archimedean spiral is given by:\n$$ \\rho = \\theta $$\nthen its parametric equation is $(\\theta\\cos\\theta,\\theta\\sin\\theta)$ and the arc length between $0$ and $\\theta_f$ is given by:\n$$ L= \\int_{0}^{\\theta_f}\\sqrt{1+\\theta^2}\\,d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\theta_f \\sqrt{1+\\theta_f^2}+\\text{arcsinh}(\\theta_f)\\right)\\approx \\theta_f \\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\theta_f^2}{4}}$$\nso a good way to place almost-equispaced point on such Archimedean spiral is to take the $N$-th point at:\n$$ \\theta_N = \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{-1+\\sqrt{1+k^2 N^2}}. $$</p>\n"},{"link":"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1302183/did-guinness-book-of-records-screw-this-up","title":"Did Guinness Book of Records screw this up?","creationDate":1432799023,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"math","questionID":1302183,"body":"<p><strong>Crossposted on HSM</strong> (<a href=\"http://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/2435/did-guinness-book-of-records-screw-this-up\">http://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/2435/did-guinness-book-of-records-screw-this-up</a>)</p>\n\n<p>See Guinness Book of Records <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-standing-maths-problem-(ever)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-standing-maths-problem-(ever)</a>.

This (along with the fact that $A$ and $X$ are on the same side of $\\overline{OY}$) implies that $A$, $X$, $Y$ are collinear.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, $B$, $W$, $Y$ are collinear, where $W$ is the diametric opposite of $X$ in $\\bigcirc R$. Observe that $E$ lies on a line through $C$ and $X$, and on line through $R$ and $Q$ (not shown above, but shown earlier). $E$ is therefore the center of a dilation between $\\bigcirc R$ to $\\bigcirc Q$. Necessarily, $E$ is on the line through $W$ and $B$. And, since $\\angle QBW \\cong \\angle RWY$, it follows that $Y$ is collinear with $W$ and $B$ (and $E$). </p>\n\n<p>Of course, going through these details greatly amplifies the imperfection of this approach.

To get the approximation of $\\pi$, I simply sum up (accumulate) the $3$rd entries from each tuple.  Notice how much quicker this is converging on the real value of $\\pi$ and with minimal work.</p>\n\n<p>Just playing around in my Excel spreadsheet with these values, I noticed that these approximations of $\\pi$ converge on the real value of $\\pi$ in a predictable way so I encoded this in the spreadsheet and I came up with an extrapolated estimate of $\\pi$ to be $3.14159265356529$ which I am quite happy with because it is as accurate as using about a $400,000$ sided polygon using Archimedes method but my method is much simpler.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, I looked at the difference between the estimate from $12$ to $6$ and from $24$ to $12$... and I see that it is approximately \"quartering\" each time.  I took that a step farther and analyzed how close to $1/4$ the difference is at each doubling and encoded that as well and just from those two simple calculations, I got a pretty decent $\\pi$ accurate to $10$ digits after the decimal point.  If I had the data on the circumscribed polygons, I suppose the # of accurate digits would increase even more.  It makes sense that there is predictability since we are doubling the # of sides each time and not some random increase like from $6$ to $10$ to $25$ sides.</p>\n\n<p>So in my extrapolation method, my first step would be to take the last known \"delta\" of $.00321190181017$ and \"quarter\" it to $0.00080297545254$ so that the next tuple entry would be (extrapolation 1, $3.14145247226851\n, 0.00042052137800, 3.99919702454746, 0.00080297545254$)</p>\n\n<p>Also it is worth mentioning that using only data from up to $24$ inscribed polygons, my extrapolation method yields a quite good approximation of $3.14159265308398$ which is accurate to $9$ places after the decimal and that is as good as using about a $100,000$ sided polygon using Archimedes method.</p>\n\n<p>So does anyone know if there is documentation that Archimedes knew about this extrapolation method (or similar) during his lifetime? </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I revisited my spreadsheet and got a more accurate version of $ \\pi$ using this method.  The tweak is in the determination/extrapolation of the 5th parameter.  I am not sure how or why this tweak works (maybe someone can explain the math behind it), but it gives an even better approximation of $ \\pi$.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than list a bunch more numbers in an already cluttered post, I will just describe the tweak and leave it at that.</p>\n\n<p>$x1$ (extrapolation 1) is exactly the same as in my previous effort (I took the 5th parameter $.00321190181017$ in the \"$96$ sided polygon\" entry and divided it by $4$ to get $.00080297545254$.</p>\n\n<p>However, for $x2$, I did NOT do a divide by $4$ to get the 5th parameter.  Instead, I used the 4th parameter of the \"$48$gon\" entry which is $3.98716270785101$.  The \"new\" 5th parm of $x2$ is now $.00020139018931\n$. I repeat this pattern for getting the next 5th parameter by \"dropping down a line\" each time.</p>\n\n<p>The \"bottom line\" is the approximation of $\\pi$ this way improves from my previous value of $3.14159265356529$ to $3.14159265358983$. Notice how the previous estimate was on the low side of the actual value of $\\pi$ but the new estimate is slightly on the high side.</p>\n\n<p>Also, here is the follow up YouTube video link for the Archimedes method of circumscribed polygon to \"sandwich\" the value of $\\pi$ between.  With those two values, the confidence level of $\\pi$ goes way up. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zO0-QOcJQ0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zO0-QOcJQ0</a></p>\n","isAnswered":true,"answer":"<p>This is not an answer, just an alternative exposition of your findings as far as I was able to reproduce them.</p>\n\n<p>First, the video describes Archimedes' method for approximating $\\pi$ via the following recurrence for the side length of a regular $3\\cdot2^n$-gon inscribed in a circle, which I'll call $\\ell_n$:\n$$ \\ell_1=1 \\text{ ,}\\qquad \\ell_{n+1} = 2\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{4-\\ell_n^2}} \\tag1 $$\nThen we approximate $\\pi$ as half the perimeter of that $3\\cdot2^n$-gon, that is,\n$$ h_n = 3\\cdot 2^{n-1} \\ell_n $$</p>\n\n<p>What you've noticed numerically is that\n$$ \\frac{h_n-h_{n-1}}{h_{n-1}-h_{n-2}} \\approx \\frac14 \\tag2 $$\n(Nice observation, by the way.

This also shows that the LHS is always $\\ge\\frac14$.)</p>\n\n<p>Next, you started approximating $h_n$ using (2) instead of the Archimedean recurrence (1).  Actually, you say you have something more precise than $\\frac14$ on the RHS of (2), but you don't say what it is, so <strong>I'll just proceed as if you used $\\frac14$.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let's call the values obtained by this method $\\hat h_n$.  Since you started using this method after the $96$-gon, the sequence is given by the rules\n$$ \\hat h_4 = h_4 \\text{ ,}\\quad \\hat h_5 = h_5 \\text{ ,}\\quad \\frac{\\hat h_n-\\hat h_{n-1}}{\\hat h_{n-1}-\\hat h_{n-2}} = \\frac14 $$\nBy telescoping product, we get\n$$ \\hat h_n - \\hat h_{n-1} = (\\hat h_5 - \\hat h_4) \\prod_{k=6}^n \\frac{\\hat h_k-\\hat h_{k-1}}{\\hat h_{k-1}-\\hat h_{k-2}}\n= \\frac{\\hat h_5 - \\hat h_4}{4^{n-5}} $$\nand then, by telescoping sum,\n$$ \\hat h_n = \\hat h_5 + \\sum_{k=6}^n (\\hat h_k-\\hat h_{k-1})\n= \\hat h_5 + (\\hat h_5-\\hat h_4)\\sum_{k=6}^n \\frac1{4^{k-5}}\n= \\hat h_5 + \\frac13 (\\hat h_5-\\hat h_4) \\Big(1-\\frac1{4^{n-4}}\\Big)\n$$\nNow you can see that as $n\\to\\infty$, we have\n$$ \\hat h_n \\to \\hat h_5 + \\frac13 (\\hat h_5-\\hat h_4)\n= \\frac{4h_5-h_4}{3}\n\\approx 3.1415925335\n$$\nSo, <em>this</em> sequence is not actually tending to $\\pi$, but to something a bit smaller.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I don't know whether Archimedes knew your method, but I will note that the summation of the infinite geometric series used here was absolutely something he knew — he did that as part of his computation of the area of a parabolic sector.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> It occurs to me that another way to use your idea is to compute $h_n$ via (1) as usual, but rather than report that as your estimate, report $(4h_n-h_{n-1})/3$.  This is as if you had used (2) starting from $n$ instead of starting from $6$, and it gives a sharper lower bound for $\\pi$.  (It's a lower bound because, as noted above, in (2) we have $\\ge$.)  You still have to use (1), unfortunately.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1000916/archimedes-trisection-of-equilateral-triangle","title":"Archimedes trisection of equilateral triangle?","creationDate":1414823533,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"math","questionID":1000916,"body":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XDIfO.jpg\" alt=\"Original Equilateral Triangle\"></p>\n\n<p>Equilateral triangle paradox </p>\n\n<p>Consider triangle  ABC: Each side is trisected - AE, FC, GB each = 1/3 of their sides.</p>\n\n<p>First we established that triangle HIJ was equilateral.

The definition you quote is basically saying: if you specify how far from $T$ you are willing to tolerate your total (no further than $L$ is from $T$ if the total is less than $T$, and no further than $M$ is from $T$ if the total is more than $T$), then you can always ensure that from some point forward the partial sums will have a total that you is within your margin of tolerance (a total that you can tolerate). This will hold no matter how tolerant or intolerant you are (you are very tolerant if you allow totals that are far away from $T$; that is, both $L$ and $M$ are \"far away\" from $T$; you are being very intolerant if your $L$ and your $M$ are really, really, really, close to $T$). You can be as intolerant as you wish, but you are required to allow <em>some</em> leeway.</p>\n\n<p>Intuitively, $T$ is what you think the sum of the series \"should\" be (if it made sense to add infinitely many numbers). The definition says that the sums you get a long the way will get \"as close as you care to specify\" to that total $T$, provided you add enough terms of your series, and that once you get there, any further refinments (by adding more terms of your series) will still keep you within your specified 'neighborhood' of $T$. It is very similar to the $\\epsilon-\\delta$ definition of a limit, if you saw that, or to the \"intuitive notion\" of limit: as long as you stay close enough to the point (for series, as long as you add up enough terms), the value of the function (for series, the running total) will be as close as you care to \"pre-specify\" from the limit (for series, as close as you care to \"pre-specify\" from $T$).</p>\n\n<p><em>Added:</em> To respond to your query in the comments: \"If we have a target value, why add the tolerance?\" Keep in mind that we can only add finitely many numbers at a time. We can add two numbers, and then using that we can add three, four, five, etc. But we don't really know what it means to add infinitely many numbers, like the series says we \"should\" or \"want\". So we cannot <em>actually</em> perform the act of adding up all the (infinitely many) terms. Rather, we can only add up to a certain number of the terms; these are the partial sums. We can (in principle, at least) compute a partial sum to any term we want, but we cannot actually add up all of them (just like we can, in principle, count as high as we want, but we cannot actually count through \"all\" the natural numbers). So what we have actual access to are the partial sums and only the partial sums. We think that if we <em>could</em> add up all the terms of the series, then it would make sense to call that sum $T$; so what we do is we compare those partial sums to our target, $T$. But of course, $T$ is supposed to be what we would get after adding up <em>all</em> the terms of the series (if we could do that), and what we are comparing is <strong>not</strong> the result of adding all the terms, but only some of them. So the total we have in hand (the partial sum) has no reason to be exactly the same as the target (just like, if you add the first 100 numbers in a list of a thousand numbers, the running total has no reason to be the same as the final total). So we need to add some tolerance to account for the fact that we are not <em>actually</em> adding up all the terms, but only some of them.</p>\n\n<p>(P.S.

Let me clarify one thing. Yes, if we can create a meaningful notion of mass (say, if there exists a translation invariant Borel measure that is finite and positive on $E$), we can define the center of mass in the usual way and the only question will be if the definition is unambiguous. However, if I give you a symmetric set, you'll not hesitate to say that the center of symmetry is also the center of mass. Also, if I give you an infinite set and add one point to it, you'll probably (but not necessarily) agree that the center of mass won't feel this addition, the reason being that the set was infinitely times more massive than the point we added not as mush because we can measure the actual mass in some way but merely because infinitely many disjoint shifts of the point fit inside the set. In other words, quite often we can determine the relative size without being able to assign any meaning to the absolute size. This is one of the loopholes in the integration theory I'd like to exploit and see how far one can get with it.

When I was questor in Sicily [in 75 BC, 137 years after the death of Archimedes] I managed to track down his grave. The Syracusians knew nothing about it, and indeed denied that any such thing existed. But there it was, completely surrounded and hidden by bushes of brambles and thorns. I remembered having heard of some simple lines of verse which had been inscribed on his tomb, referring to a sphere and cylinder modelled in stone on top of the grave. And so I took a good look round all the numerous tombs that stand beside the Agrigentine Gate. Finally I noted a little column just visible above the scrub: it was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder. I immediately said to the Syracusans, some of whose leading citizens were with me at the time, that I believed this was the very object I had been looking for.

If the former convention is adopted then it can be proven using a completely unexceptionable Euclidean argument that $\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\sin(x)/x = 1$.  Also, whichever convention is adopted (or so it seems to me), using completely unexceptionable Euclidean arguments, it is possible to prove the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine.

Of course, it is just this postulate that Archimedes needed to prove that the area of a circle is equal to the area of a triangle with base the circumference of the circle and height the radius.  And something like it is surely necessary to derive any algorithm for computing digits of $\\pi$.

Also, are more intuitive alternatives to Archimedes' postulate?  Second, what is really needed to get an algorithm for computing digits of sine?  Does it really require such complicated technology as Taylor series?

But they never say who first proved it. I expected it to be in Euclid's <em>Elements</em>, but was surprised to find that it isn't. Can I take that to mean that it hadn't been proved by then? I would be very surprised if the proof was known to Euclid and he had not included it in <em>Elements.</em></p>\n\n<p>Note: Euclid does contain Eudoxus's proposition that $A_1/A_2=d_1^2/d_2^2$, where the $A_i$ are the areas of the two circles (<em>Elements</em> XII.2: Circles are to one another as the squares on their diameters.). This implies that the value of $A/d^2$ is independent of the choice of circle. </p>\n\n<p>If we jump ahead a few years from Euclid we find the fact that $C/d$ is constant given implicitly in Archimedes's <em>Measurement of the Circle</em>. First of all, he finds bounds for $C/d$ (it being between $223/71$ and $22/7$). So presumably he knew that it was a constant. But also, it follows logically from his result that $A=rC/2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle (Archimedes says that the area of a circle is equal to the area of a triangle with height $r$ and base $C$): if we take Eudoxus's proposition as saying $A=kd^2$ (for some constant $k$) and Archimedes's result as $A=dC/4$, then setting them equal we get $kd^2=dC/4$, or equivalently $C/d=4k$ (i.e., $k=\\pi/4$).</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: who first prove this fact? Was it Archimedes? I've read that the version of the <em>Measurement of the Circle</em> that we have may be only a part of what Archimedes actually wrote. Do people conjecture that it was proved and stated explicitly in the missing part of this document?</p>\n\n<p>This all seems very mysterious to me. I would be a little surprised to discover that the answer to this question is lost to history since it is such a major mathematical result (but maybe that is so). I would be surprised if it took until Archimedes to get a proof of this; if it was \"known\" empirically for the entire Greek period (which I assume it was), one would imagine that a rigorous proof would be highly sought after. One imagines a proof would have been within Eudoxus's reach.

Is one of them the discoverer, and if so which one?</p>\n\n<p>The printed solution, both in the <em>Monthly</em> article and in the book by Klosinski, Alexanderson, and Larson, says only \"The standard approach, from elementary calculus, applies. By division, rewrite the integrand as a polynomial plus a rational function with numerator of degree less than 2. The solution follows easily.\"  But surely there's more to be said, because this integral is a minor miracle of mathematics:</p>\n\n<p>$\\bullet$ Not only is the integrand manifestly positive, but it is always small: $x-x^2 \\in [0,1/4]$ for $x \\in [0,1]$, and the denominator $1+x^2$ is at least 1, so $(x-x^2)^4/(x^2+1) &lt; 1/4^4 = 1/256$.  A better upper bound on the integral is $\\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^4 dx$, which comes to $1/630$ either by direct expansion or by recognizing the Beta integral $B(5,5)=4!^2/9!$.  Hence $\\frac{22}{7} - \\pi &lt; 1/630$, which also yields Archimedes's lower bound $\\pi &gt; 3\\frac{10}{71}$.</p>\n\n<p>$\\bullet$ The \"standard approach\" explains how to evaluate the integral, but not why the answer is so simple.

[This much I can understand: the numerator $(x-x^2)^4$ takes the same value $(1\\pm i)^4 = -4$ at both roots of the denominator $x^2+1$.]  When we integrate the polynomial part, we might\nexpect to combine fractions with denominators of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, obtaining a complicated rational number.  But only 7 appears: there's no $x$ or $x^3$ term; the $x^4$ coefficient 5 kills the denominator of 5; and the terms $-4x^5-4x^2$ might have contributed denominators of 6 and 3 combine to yield the integer $-1$.</p>\n\n<p>Compare this with the next such integrals\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^6 \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = \\frac{38429}{13860} - 4 \\log 2\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^8 \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = 4\\pi - \\frac{188684}{15015},\n$$\nwhich yield better but much more complicated approximations to $\\log 2$ and $\\pi$...</p>\n\n<p>This suggests a refinement of the \"in what context\" part of the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does that integral for $(22/7)-\\pi$ generalize to give further approximations to $\\pi$ (or $\\log 2$ or similar constants) that are useful for the study of Diophantine properties of $\\pi$ (or $\\log 2$ etc.)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n","isAnswered":true,"answer":"<p>Jonathan M.

You might also recognize this as the volume of the unit ball $B_{2n}$.  There is a simple symplectic map from $B_{2n}$ to $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ which is 1-to-1 in the interior and quotients the boundary to $\\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}$.

I cannot judge about the question whether this is the \"ultimate\" reason. But if we look into Euclid's elements, we find many diagrams where all points and also all lengths (magnitudes) are labeled with Greek uppercase symbols. It is said that Euler introduced the convention to label points of triangles with uppecase Latin letters and sides with lower case Latin letters and angles with lower case Greek letters. Probably the middle- and high-school textbooks, as many other elements of mathematics, adhere to the custom invented by Euler. But when we have a closer look into his books, first of all his INTRODUCTIO IN ANALYSIN INFINITORUM, we find that he used also lower case symbols to label points.

But if you get the angle right, the sun should be high enough to not get in your eyes, but reflect into the enemy's.</p>\n\n<p>I can only think of a few reasons why this wasn't actually done in the past: 1)- mirrors were too expensive, and 2)- soldiers were too dirty. 2 can be solved by holding some water in reserve, and washing the shields right before battle, but 1 is really up to you; get as much mirror as you think the army can afford, and divide it up among your front line.  </p>\n"},{"link":"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/15261/would-a-medieval-society-based-on-simple-hydroponic-be-posible","title":"Would a medieval society based on simple hydroponic be posible","creationDate":1430138490,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"worldbuilding","questionID":15261,"body":"<p>In relation to a previous question: <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/9573/would-a-medieval-arcology-be-possible\">Would a medieval Arcology be possible?</a> we established that without a water source it would not be posible to have a society.</p>\n\n<p>We also established that we need a certain number of square miles per person to be able to sustain food production: <a href=\"https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/9582/how-many-people-can-you-feed-per-square-kilometer-of-farmland\">How many people can you feed per square-kilometer of farmland?</a></p>\n\n<p>Pack-animals used for travel between cities can be used for food source when an animal is no longer able to make the travel.

Modern (!) hydroponics might reduce that to a 3rd. So let's be really, really optimistic and assume 100m².</p>\n\n<p>How much roof area you have per person can easily be measured by how much living-space you have per person.</p>\n\n<p>My apartment is 60 m².

So the roof area available for me would also be about 60 m².</p>\n\n<p>60 m² per person would be quite decadent for the middle ages. It is even quite decadent for todays standards, because I am living alone. Even today a four-person family living in the city rarely has an apartment with more than 100 m². I would rather estimate the floor-area and by induction also the roof-area per person in a medieval town to be a lot less, more in the area of 20 m².</p>\n\n<p>Sure, we excluded any public buildings, but we also did not take residential buildings with more than one floor into account, so these two factors should cancel out.</p>\n\n<p>20 m² is simply not enough to feed the person living below it, even with high-tech methods, let alone medieval methods. The only way to increase the output would be with multi-story farming and artificial light sources, but the technology to create artificial UV light didn't exist back then.</p>\n"},{"link":"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/11916/what-would-it-take-to-actually-move-the-earth-using-a-lever","title":"What would it take to actually move the Earth using a lever?","creationDate":1426342317,"checked":false,"isBad":false,"isGood":false,"site":"worldbuilding","questionID":11916,"body":"<p>Archimedes claimed that he would lift the Earth if he could find a suitable place outside it, with his knowledge of mechanics.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: What kind of set-up (e.g. how large lever or how massive support to stand etc.) would Archimedes require to carry out this project?

By infeasible, I mean it has multiple problems. The first is simply getting that much material without it bending, twisting, or snapping. The second is getting a material that has the strength needed to act as a fulcrum. The third is getting enough gravity on the Archimedes end of things so he can exert that force on that lever.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, there is no material that would be that strong.
